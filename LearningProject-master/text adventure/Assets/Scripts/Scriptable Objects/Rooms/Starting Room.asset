  roomDescription: 'You wake up in the cold hard floor of some unknown place.

    You take a look around. the room you''re in seems rather austere, save for the
    desk and bookcase, both with guilded wood carvings.

    "Fancy woodwork", you think to yourself.

    You continue looking around the room, and see some chains hanging from the ceiling,
    and some more, from the wall next to a robust looking metal door.

    You appear to be in a makeshift prison cell.

    Fortunately, the time you spent watching MacGyver episodes in your childhood was
    not for naught.

    What do you do?
